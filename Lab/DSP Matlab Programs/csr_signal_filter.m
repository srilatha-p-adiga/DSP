% 1. Write a Matlab program to generate a composite signal that contains 20 tones of random frequency 
%    with a max frequency of 5 KHz. Find the spectrum of this composite signal.										(7 + 8 Marks)

% 2. Write a Matlab program to design a third ordered digital Chebychev filter with a ripple of 1 dB in the
%   passband using bilinear transformation to pass signals up to 500 Hz frequency. Assume a sampling frequency
%   of 10 KHz. Find the spectrum of the output of the designed filter by passing the signal generated
%   in Question No. 1 through it.	(12 + 13 Marks)
